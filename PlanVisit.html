    <h2>Here are the top tips to help your trip:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Pack your patience: millions of people visit Yosemite from April through October. Yosemite Valley is the main destination for most visitors but there are many places to go in the park.</li>
        <li>Early birds avoid traffic! From spring through fall, arrive in the park before or after peak hours (before 9 am and after 5 pm) to avoid delays and traffic congestion.</li>
        <li>Plan ahead: Due to current health guidelines, reservations are required to drive into Yosemite until October 31, as well as for lodging, camping, and backpacking.</li>
        <li>Keep wildlife wild: do not approach or feed animals.</li>
        <li>Drive responsibly: observe posted speed limits and use pullouts to take pictures and let other cars pass.</li>
        <li>Protect Yosemite’s bears: always practice proper food storage and follow speed limits.</li>
        <li>Staying connected: cellular service is limited. Don’t be surprised if you can’t receive calls or texts in the park.</li>
